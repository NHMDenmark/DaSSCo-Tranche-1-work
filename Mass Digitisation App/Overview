The Mass Digitisation App was developed by DaSSCo to capture broad information (e.g., on front of folders or drawers) that is associated with multiple specimens.
This information is often taxonomy and broad geographic region. However, it may also include other details such as storage location of type status (where all type specimens are stored together).
Information is entered into the app at the same stage (or near enough) to an image of the specimen label (+/- an image of the specimen as well). 
The information from the mass digitisation app is imported into Specify and can be linked via the storage with the images. 

The Mass Digitisation App Github board is here: https://github.com/orgs/NHMDenmark/projects/35/views/1
