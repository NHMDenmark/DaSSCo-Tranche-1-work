This workstation and workflow was developed to simultaneously image labels and pinned insect specimens when the labels are taken off of the pins (and placed on a tray with the specimen for imaging)
Broad information is captured using the Mass Digitizer app at the same time, so that the images and a specimen recrod can be associated in Specify.
This workstation and workflow was developed for use by NHMD and NHMA (with slight differences between them).
