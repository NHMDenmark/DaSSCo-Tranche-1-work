All workstations and workflows developed should have documentation on here. As a minimum each should have:
- A workflow diagram in a standard format
- Training guides / detailed digitisation guides
- An overview
- List of requirements/features
- Details of the components of the workflow
- Link to relevant Github board


For workflow diagrams, we will use the templates and instructions used on the DiSSCo site: https://dissco.github.io/Guidance/GitHub.html
